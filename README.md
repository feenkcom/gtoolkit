# The Moldable Development Environment
[Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com) is the Moldable Development Environment. It empowers you to make systems explainable through contextual micro tools.

## Download and run the ready made distribution

Simply download: https://gtoolkit.com/download.
The download is a self contained installation made of a Glamorous Toolkit image, a virtual machine, and a few other resources and libraries.
Now, just run the executable.
- On Mac: `GlamorousToolkit.app`
- On Windows: `.\bin\GlamorousToolkit.exe`
- On Linux: `./bin/GlamorousToolkit`

## Install from sources

Executing the script below installs the VM, clones the sources and builds an image. It can takes ~10 minutes and it is useful for developing Glamorous Toolkit itself.

- On Mac: `curl https://dl.feenk.com/scripts/mac.sh | bash`
- On Linux: `curl https://dl.feenk.com/scripts/linux.sh | bash`
- On Windows: `wget https://dl.feenk.com/scripts/windows.ps1 -OutFile windows.ps1; ./windows.ps1`

## Get started

### Learn how to learn

Glamorous Toolkit was developed following Moldable Development. In the core distribution there are thousands of contextual tools that we used to develop and explain the environment. Each of these is based on an underlying language made out of visual and interactive operators that can be combined in many ways. So, first learn this language:
- Start by watching the [GT in 7' video series](https://youtu.be/-vFwfwy5WZA?list=PLfrs5bwLJOoAaHvQGSLeKpHWmFuZXPUTJ).
- Read the book directly in the environment or [online](https://book.gtoolkit.com).

### Pick a problem you care about
Moldable Development is about adapting the environment to match the context. So, pick a problem you care about and work your way through it.

## Glamorous Toolkit and Pharo
Glamorous Toolkit is built in [Pharo](https://pharo.org) and Rust, and it also enables people to work with Pharo systems. Nevertheless, the goal of Glamorous Toolkit is distinct from that of Pharo and so is its realization.
